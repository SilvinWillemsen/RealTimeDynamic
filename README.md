# RealTimeDynamic

This is the accompanying repository for the DAFx 2022 paper submission titled "Real-Time Implementation of the Dynamic Stiff String using Finite-Difference Time-Domain Methods and the Dynamic Grid" by Silvin Willemsen and Stefania Serafin.

It contains a real-time implementation of the "dynamic stiff string". The underlying physical parameters of the string can be varied in real time to create sounds impossible in the real world.
